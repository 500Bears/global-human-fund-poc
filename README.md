# Global Human Fund Proof of Concept

## Overview

This repository contains a proof-of-concept implementation of a Global Human Fund system. This system demonstrates a conceptual design for a global achievement-based reward system and universal basic income distribution mechanism.

The concept explores the idea of a centralized fund that:
- Registers all humans with a unique ID
- Records and values human achievements
- Periodically distributes funds to all registered humans

## Disclaimer

This is a simplified proof of concept and not a fully functional system. It is intended for educational and demonstrative purposes only. Implementing such a system in reality would require extensive international cooperation, significant technological infrastructure, and careful consideration of numerous ethical, legal, and logistical challenges.

## Features

- Human registration with unique IDs
- Achievement recording and fund contribution
- Periodic fund distribution
- Public dashboard display

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/global-human-fund-poc.git
   cd global-human-fund-poc
   ```
3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

## Usage

Run the script using Python:

```
python global_human_fund_poc.py
```

This will demonstrate the basic functionality of the system, including human registration, achievement recording, and fund distribution.

## Structure

- `global_human_fund_poc.py`: Main script containing the `Human` and `CentralHumanFund` classes
- `README.md`: This file, containing project information and instructions
- `LICENSE`: The license file for this project

## Limitations and Future Considerations

This proof of concept is greatly simplified and does not address many real-world challenges, including:

- Security and privacy concerns
- Scalability to billions of users
- Fair valuation of diverse human achievements
- Integration with existing economic systems
- Legal and regulatory compliance
- Prevention of fraud and abuse

Future developments could explore these areas and more.
